My goal for the project is to create a beautiful, audioreactive
3D noise flow field inspired by the game 'The Polynomial'
(see 'Screenshots' floder).

I am planning to implement 2 modes users can switch between:
1. Camera looks at the flow field from a distance (multiple angles
can be cycled through).
2. Users can fly through the flow field in a spaceship-like
FPS controller. 

To generate my noise, I'm going to use the Fast Noise library,
found at this link:
https://github.com/Auburns/FastNoise_CSharp

my Unity version for the project is v2018.2.9f
